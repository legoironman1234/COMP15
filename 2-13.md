## Admin
- Both parts have an autograder
- Use assert in unit_tests because of subtle differences in string
- Only put `using namespace std;` in .cpp files
	- Not in header files except for `unit_tests.h`
	- Don't "force" the namespace onto a file

## File I/O
- Useful to MetroSim
- **Stream:** Flow of characters from one place to another
	- Input: Read _from_
		- E.g. `cin`
	- Output: Write _to_
		- E.g. `cout, cerr`
### `fstream` library
- `ifstream`
	- Stream class for reading from files
- `ofstream`
	- Stream class for writing to files
- `fstream`
	- Stream class for both reading from and writing to files
- ==Classes just like normal classes, can define objects of them==
```c++
#include <fstream>
int num;
ifstream instream;
ofstream outstream;

instream.open("filename1");

if (not instream.is_open()) {
	cerr << "Unable to open input file."
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

instream.open("filename2");

if (not outstream.is_open()) {
	cerr << "Unable to open output file."
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}


```
### Using
1. Open file
2. Check if streams were correctly opened, using `is_open()` bool
	- No permission
	- Input file name doesn't exist, output file name doesn't exist $\implies$ file will be created
==This is repetitive, make a function!==

```c++
#include <fstream>

int main() {
	ifstream instream;
	ofstream outstream;

	open_or_die(instream, "input.txt");
	open_or_die(outstream, "output.txt");
}
template<typename streamtype> //this is a variable for a type, creates a generic function
//always pass streams by reference, because there is no copy constructor
void open_or_die(streamtype &stream, string file_name) {
	stream.open(file_name);
	if (not stream.is_open()) {
		cerr << "Unable to open: " << file_name << endl;
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}
```
3. Use file
	- Exactly like `cin` and `cout`
	- `getline()` uses a reference parameter of a string, so it can modify the original string in memory
		- To read in full stream, you can use `getline()` as a while loop condition
		- `while (getline(ifstream, get_line)) {...}`
		- skips over empty lines ==maybe, this is not working for me???==
	- `eof` might read one extra time than needed
	- `getline(ifstream, get_line).fail()`
		- Does the `getline()` actions, then returns `true` if it failed
	- `(ifstream >> x).fail()`
		- Does the `>>` operation, then returns `true` if it failed
		- Can happen if bad type, ex. reading a `string` when expecting `int`
#### Parameterise the output streams
- Parent classes of `ifstream` and `ofstream`
	- `istream`: general input streams
	- `ostream:` general output streams
```c++
int main() {
	ifstream instream;
	ofstream outstream;

	if (using_cin_and_cout) {
		foo(cin, cout);	
	} else {
		open_or_die(instream, "input.txt");
		open_or_die(outstream, "output.txt");
	}
	return 0;
}
void foo(istream &input, ostream &output) { //streams have to be reference
	int x;
	//get the input
	input >> x; /*OR*/ getline(input, x);

	//write the output
	output << x;
}
```
``

4. Close file
	- ==Pretty damn important!!==

### Applications
- Remember: `argc` is number of command line arguments, `argv[]` is an array of the commands text
- `isprime.cpp`: Should have everything for MetroSim's File I/O

## Recursion
- **Recursive definition:** refers to itself
- **Recursive data structure:** Contains reference to same data structure
- *To solve a problem by breaking it down into a smaller instance of same problem*
- Only reason recursion works is because the stack creates different instances of variables in the stack frame

### Parts
- **Base case:** Simple function, just returns a value
- **Recursive case:** Complex function, _breaks down problem into smaller problem_
	- Assume that the function works
	- We have to move towards the base case
	- Perform any actions you have to take care of for the recursive case

### Factorials
$$5! = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$
- Has subexpression, 4!
	- Has subexpression, 3!, *etc*
	- *Break down until 0, then solve from there*
```c++ 
int fact(int n) {
	if (n == 0) {
		return 1;
	} else {
		return n * fact(n - 1);
	}
}
```

### Countdown
```c++
void countdown(int n) {
	if (n == 0) {
		cout << "Blastoff" << endl;
	} else {
		cout << n << endl;
		countdown(n - 1);
		//if recursive lines were flipped, we would go to base case, then count upwards from there
	}
}
```

### `num_coins`
- What is the largest coin you can take out
- Once taken out some number of cents, what is the largest coin you can take out
