# Project 2 Background
- Reverse Polish Notation
- **Review:** Lecture on stacks and exceptions
- Binary operators between operands: **infix notation**
	- Has a fundamental ambiguity
- **Prefix**
	- `+ 3 4`
- **Postfix**
	- `3 4 +`
- No ambiguity in prefix or postfix notation
## Reverse Polish Notation
- An operator acts on the last two values as operands
`4 5 6 + * = 44`
- Stacks work really well with RPN
	- Lets us see the most recently seen values
### Algorithm
1. Read in input one time at a time
	-  For each number, push it on the stack
	-  For each binary operator
		- Pop two numbers from the stack
		- Apply the operator to the two numbers
		- Push the result onto the stack
2. Final value on stack is the result

When order matters, "deeper" item on stack comes first

# Trees
- Total order on strucutre: a first element, a second element, etc.
- Linear structures have costly operation time sometimes
## Definition
- Empty or nonempty
- Distinguished node is called the **root**
- Each node points to zero or more **subtrees**
	- Pointers are **directed edges** or **edges**
	- "Parent and child"
- Root has no parents
- Every other node has *one* parent
## Algorithm
- Base case: the empty tree is a tree
- Recursive case: a tree is a node with pointers to zero or more trees
## Vocabulary 
- Leaf = node with no children
- Internal = node that is not a leaf
- Length = Number of edges to get 
- Height(node) = longest path from that node to a leaf 
- Height(tree) = height(root)
	- Height(empty) = -1 
- Depth = length of path from root to node
- Binary tree = Every node has *at most* two children
## Implementation
- Need to use list of pointers to other nodes as children (unsure of number of children)
### Examples
- `int sum (IntTreeNode *node)`
	- Base case: There is no node, return data
	- Recursive case: sum(child1) + sum(child2)

**Answer:**
	if node is nullptr return 0
	else return node's data + sum(child1), sum(child2)


- `int size (IntTreeNode *node)`
	- Base case: There is no node, return 1
	- Recursive case: sum(child1) + sum(child2)
**Answer:**
	if node is nullptr return 0
	else return 1 + size(child1) + size(child2)

- `int height (IntTreeNode *node)`
	- Base case
		- if no node empty return -1
		- if 1 node return 0
	- Recursive case
		- return 1 + (height node)
**Answer:**
	if node is nullptr return -1
	else return 1 + max(height(child1),height(child2))

- `bool contains (IntTreeNode *node)`
	- Base case: if node contains data return true
	- Recursive case: if child1 or child2 contains data return false
**Answer:**
if node is nullptr return false (before to avoid segfault)
if data is val return true
	else return contains(child1) or contains(child2)
