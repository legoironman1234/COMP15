- a `.cyl` file is an input file for CalcYouLater
	- run with `./cylc` to remove comments from input files
		- ==make sure to add comments because the commands are hard to understand==
	- ==somehow add to makefile rule?==
- Start with `add.cyl`
- Make own input files
	- ==comment files, step by step==
	- if not trying to test a query, ==write at top what overall behavior you want to test==

## Invariant: 
A program property that should always remain true
	Should make programming easier $\impliedby$ less things to worry about

## Invariant checklist
1. Constructor establishes invariant
	- E.g. `size = 0`
2. Invariant assumed true at start of every public function (interface)
	- E.g. `print()` can use the `size` properly
3. Member function may temporarily violate invariant
	- E.g. `size` is not always the number of variants
4. Member functions must *restore* the invariant so that #2 can exist

# Binary-search tree
- An invariant of a binary tree
	- For every node with a key _k_ (remember to check the ancestor and parent nodes)
	- Nodes with keys less than *k* must be in left subtree
	- Nodes with keys greater than *k* must be in right subtree
	- Duplicate nodes might depend on implementation
		- ==In sets, can assume no duplicates, by defn==
- **Trivial case:** a small version of the big problem
## `contains()`

```c++
bool BST::contains(KeyType key) {
	return contains(key, root);
}

bool BST::contains(KeyType key, BSTNode *tree) {
	if (isEmpty(tree)) {return false;}
	else if (node == key) {return true;}
	else if (node < key) 
		{return contains(key, tree->left);}
	else //key > tree->key
		return contains(key, tree->right);
}
```

**Complexity:**
- BST is bushy/balanced $\implies O\log(n)$
	- Every step in tree cuts search space in half
	- ==More work needs to be done to get here==
- In general, BST is $O\log(n)$, which is same as going through linked list

## `min()`

```c++
//Go as left as possible
int BST::min() {
	if (isEmpty(tree)) {return INT_MAX;}
	else if (isEmpty(tree->left)) {return key;}
	else return min(tree->left);
}
```
**Complexity:**

	- Every step in tree cuts search space in half
	- ==More work needs to be done to get here==

## `depth()`

```c++
//iterative solution
int BST::depth(BSTNode *nodep, int key) {
	int d = 0;
	BSTNode *p = nodep;
	while (p->key != key) {
	//Want to go left or right
	//For each step, increment d
	}
}

//recursive solution
int BST::depth(BSTNode* nodep, int key) {
	if (nodep->key == key) {return 0;}
	else if (key < nodep->key) {
	return 1 + depth(nodep->left, key);
	}
	else //(key > nodep->key)
	{return 1 + depth(nodep->right, key);}
}
```

## `dist()`

```c++

int BST:dist(BSTNode *nodep, int key) {
	if (high < nodep->key) 
	// based on assumption that low < high
    // both high and low are in left subtree
    return dist(nodep->left, low, high);
  else if (low > nodep->key)
    // both high and low are in right subtree
    return dist(nodep->right, low, high);
  else
    // this is where we “split”
    //lowest common ancestor case
    return depth(nodep, low)+depth(nodep, high);
}
```

## `insert()`

- We want a bushy BST but for now let's look at "naive"
**Implementation:**
```c++
//wrapper that assigns pointer to new root of tree
void BST::unbalancedInsert(KeyType key) {
	root = unbalancedInsert(key, root);
}

BST::BSTNode BST::insert(KeyType key, BSTNode* tree) {
// Tree is empty: Make new node set it as root
if (isEmpty(tree)) {
	return newBSTNode(key);
}
// Key < root: insert(node->left, val)
else if (key < tree->key) {
	tree->left = unbalancedInsert(tree->left, key);
}
// Key > root: insert(node->right, val)
else {
	tree->right = unbalancedInsert(tree->right, key);
	return tree;
	}
}

```
