# Tree Implementation
- See [[2-22]]

# Finite Maps
- Collection of (key, value) pairs
	- Key is what we use for look up
	- Value is the data stored
- _Dictionary: key = word, value = definition_

## `add(key, val)`
- `map[key] = val`

## `remove(key)`
- removes pair from map

## `lookup(key)`
- returns the associated value
- `map[k]`

## `reassign(key, val)`
- `map[key] = val`

# Binary Trees

## :=
- Tree where every node has a max of 2 children
## Height
- Max height of a tree is `n - 1`
- Min height, "fill up each level", $\therefore \log(n)$ min_height = m - 1 and 2^(min height) $\implies O\log(n)$

## Usage in arithmetic operations

### `printExp(root)`

else
- print left parenthesis
- `printExp(child1 data)`
- `printExp(root data)`
- print right parenthesis

**Answer:**
if node is nullptr
	return
else if node is leaf (only leaves are operands!)
	print data at node
else
	parenthesis
	`printExp(left)`
	print data at node
	`printExp(right)`
	parenthesis

## Traversals
- **Depth-first traversals:** Go as deep as possible until cannot, then backtrack

- In-order
	- Handle empty tree 
	- Recursively visit left subtree
	- Visit current
	- Recursively visit right subtree
- Pre-order
	- Handle empty tree 
	- Visit current
	- Recursively visit left subtree
	- Recursively visit right subtree
- Post-order
	- Handle empty tree 
	- Recursively visit left subtree
	- Recursively visit right subtree
	- Visit current
	 ==Handy in recycling memory==

- **Breadth-first:** Go level by level ($\Delta$depth)
	- Not supported well with recursion
