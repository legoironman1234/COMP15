- Could search through files one at a time
- Could get an index given a query (given a hash)
	- Up to you to figure out the lower level details

# Graph Traversals
- Graphs have nodes and edges
- Edges can be undirected or directed, weighted or unweighted
- Adjacency matrix: very fast for looking up, but can take up a lot more space than needed if *sparse*
- Adjacency list: maintain the collection of vertices that a node points to, no wasted space, but longer lookup time

- With directed, unweighted graphs
	- An undirected graph is just directed but in two directions

- A tree is a graph *without cycles* and *all nodes are connected*
	- A tree is a connected, acyclic graph

## Practice
- Is a graph a tree?
	- Go through all vertices (==traverse the graph==), check if one has already been seen
	- At end, check if graph has been traversed in full (any nodes left behind?)

## Common graph questions
- Is there a path between two nodes?
- What is the shortest path between two nodes?
	- Because graph is unweighted, shortest graph == fewest edges

### Shortest path
==Breadth-first traversal== in contrast to a depth-first traversal
- If start node == destination node
- Visit neighbors of the start node, if these include the destination, done
- Visit neighbors of neighbors of the start node, if these include destination, done

## vs. Tree Traversals
- No starting point in a graph
- Graphs can be cyclical
	- Need to keep track of already visited nodes, stop if have seen one again
		- Implementation: can be in node struct, have to clear field at end for clean up!

## Breadth-first traversal
- Starting at a given node, $v_1$
- For all unvisited neighbors of the node
	- Dequeue the current node
	- Set to visited
	- Set distance of node to `curr_dist + 1`
	- Add neighbor to queue
- 

- Orphans will have `sentinel` distance and `false` visit

- Want path?
	- Need predecessor, same process but just add predecessor to a field in the node struct

**Complexity:** 
- Initialise, O(n)
- Start queue, O(1)
- Looping through neighbors: O(n)
- Dequeueing a node: O(1)
- Loop of unvisited neighbors: O($e_{adj}$) $e_{adj}$ is number of edges adjacent to current node
	- Compexity is bigger if adjacency matrix, because have to go through more of matrix
Final: $O(\| V\| + \| V\| \cdot \| E\|) \implies O(\| V\| + \|E\|)$  or $O(\|V\|^2)$


## Depth-first traversal
- Go as far as you can, then when hit the end, backtrack and run all other directions until you cannot anymore

```
dfs(Vertex start):
    for each Vertex v:

       v.visited = false;
    dfs_helper(start);

dfs_helper(Verted current):
    current.visited = true;
    ...do whatever you want with current...
    for each neighbor n of current:

        if not n.visited:
            dfs_helper(n);
```

==Same complexity as BFS==

**Practice:** 
BFS: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 5, 4, 8
DFS: 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 4
