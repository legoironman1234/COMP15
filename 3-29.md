# Finite Maps
- Key-value pairs in _finite maps_
- Values can be arbitarily complex, lots of different data in one
`insert()`
`find()`
`remove()`
- `unordered_map` in C++ (uses a hash) or `ordered_map` (uses a BST, assumes comparability)
- LL, AL, sorted AL, balanced BST have same worst and average case complexities

# Hashes
- Average case: O(1) insert find remove, so cool!
- Hashes are *very powerful* but some limitations
- An AL is a hash with integer keys
- Every key needs to be mapped to a single value (lists of people with the same age)
- O(1) with integer keys of reasonable size
- *Non-integer keys must be converted into integers*
	- In a two letter dictionary, $26^1 l_{1}+ 26^{0}{l_2}$
- A good hash function is
	- fast
	- deterministic
	- assigns different keys to same buckets with extremely low probability
	- spreads out keys well (close keys get mapped to far apart values)

## Compression function
- Use mod to put in range of `arraySize`

## Collisions
- Two keys map to same bucket
- Can be through the same output from hash function or compression function
- Client wants to store/retrieve two different pairs but hash/compression functions put them in the same bucket
	- That is not the client's problem, but yours

## Avoiding Collisions
- Pick a good hash function
	- With appropriate `arraySize`
	- A *one-to-one* hash function is a **perfect hash function**
- Have a handle for collided keys

## Handling Collisions 
- **Chaining:** Put a list in each hash bucket
	```
	insert(key, value):
	if (key is in table[bucket])
		find key-value object in list, update value
	else
		add key-value object to list
	```
Yes, this is O(n), but average you will only have *3 to 4* collisions, which is O(1)
- **Open addressing:**
- Put it in a spare space in the table
