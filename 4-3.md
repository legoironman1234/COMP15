# Hashes (again)
- Turn a key into an integer, and index to array with that integer
- **Compression function** to get an integer into a specific range
	- Will get more **collisions**, two different keys apply to same bucket
- Have different approaches to collisions
	- Avoid them by a good hash function, and an appropriate table size
	- Be able to solve collisions when they happen
		- *Chaining:* Put a list in each bucket, and append on collisions
		- *Open addressing:* Insert new pair into spare space in table

## Hash functions
- Good hash functions are fast, deterministic, little same mapping key repeats, closely related pairs are mapped far from each other

## Chaining
- Put a list in each bucket, and append on collisions
- Worst case complexity: $O(n)$
- Average case complexity: $O(1)$
	- assuming a good hash function that spreads outputs out well, and appropriate table size

## Open Addressing
- Needs *at least one* extra space to use this approach
- Worst case complexity, insert: $O(n)$ 
- Worst case complexity, lookup: $O(table\_size)$
- Worst case is when collisions are frequent
#### Linear probing 
- If full when we get to key, keep on moving forward until we find an empty place 
- Each bucket now has to store a boolean to say if it was filled, because we cannot tell if something is "empty" by just checking memory
- Would create holes when you remove, and to search for a key you want to stop when there is an empty space
	- Three states of a bucket:
		- Filled
		- Empty, but previously filled ("tombstone case")
		- Empty, but never filled
- Clusters are bad for time complexity
	- Has to iterate more through table to get to element, *violates constant time*
#### Quadratic probing
- `bucket to use = bucketfor(key) + attempt^2` `attempt = [0,empty spot]`
	- wrapping around when needed
#### Double hashing
- If collision, run a different hash function

## Load Factor
- How full a table is, e.g. $$\frac{\textrm{\# elements in table}}{\textrm{\# buckets in table}}$$
- max(load factor) = 1 in open addressing, infinite in chaining
- Load factor is empirically determined to be 0.7 or 0.75
- When load factor is too much, we can expand $\textrm{\# buckets in table}$
	- But now each key will map to different bucket $\% arraySize$ has changed
		- Need to **rehash**, go over each element in table, and update bucket with new `arraySize`

## Birthday Paradox
- There will always be collisions
- So it does not take that many random numbers to get to a collisions
- As long as you handle a collision well, you still get average $O(1)$ time

## Extras
- Hashes are probably not good for sorting
	- Have to traverse full table

# Implementation
- A lot like ArrayLists but...
- Given a key, must run through hash + compression function 
- Can't change the keys of a hash
- Must account for collisions (using chaining, probing)
- Expand when hitting max load factor
	- Rehash when expanding
