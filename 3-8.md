# Huffman Coding
- A tool to achieve data compression
	- Data compression can also increase speed of data transfers

## Compression
- Lossy: Willing to lose information
	- Mainly throw away data that does not affect human perception
- Lossless: Compressing data without sacrificing data
	- Works through exploitation of redundancy


Going to read the path to different ASCII encodings: **code tree**
	*0* is left bit
	*1* is right bit

Shortened encoding: Use path instead of ASCII, need less characters than $2^7$

Variable length encoding: Fewer bits for more frequent characters, more bits for more frequently used characters

Decoding: Fundamental ambiguity in variable-length code
	Morse code has brief spaces, but binary has \_\_\_\_?

 Prefix-free code: No encoding is the prefix of another encoding
	A code tree where all characters are leaves, no other character occurs on path from the root to any other character

**Huffman tree:** The leaves correspond to characters, more frequent characters are closer to root

## To build a Huffman Tree

- Start at the bottom of the tree and build up to the root, **bottom out algorithm**
- Create a node for each character you want to encode
	- Store character
	- Frequency of characters
- Pick the two subtrees with the lowest counts
- Join together with a parent that has the sum of the counts of the child letters
- Repeat the process until only one tree forms
