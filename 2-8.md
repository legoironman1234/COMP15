- MetroSim deliverable 1 due 2/15 (next Wednesday!)
- MetroSim deliverable 2 due 2/21 (next, next Tuesday!)
## MetroSim Demo
- Diff and play with `the_MetroSim`
- Originally, no passengers on train
- Train moves with `m m` 
	- "metro move"
- Passengers added with `p start_number end_number`
	- Automatically given an id in order
		- id is a running count
- Train stations are also automatically given an id
- Output is only written when passenger gets to train
- ==START EARLY==
## Complexity
- 2^10 O(1)
- 4n O(n)
- (10^100)\*n O(n)
- 3n + 100log(n) O(n) 
- nlogn O(n log n)
- 4nlogn O(n log n)
- n^2 + logn O(n^2)
- n^3 O (n^3)
- 2^n O(2^n), exponential means bad news

## Queues
- Just a line
- Add to back and remove from front
- **FIFO:** First in, first out
- Cannot get into the middle of the queue, more restricted version of a list
- LinkedList with back ptr is greater than ArrayList for queue because `pushBack` and `pushFront` are O(1)
	- O(n) in ArrayList
### Operations
- `enqueue(element)`
	- Add `element` to back
- `dequeue()`
	- Removes `element` from front
	- Could return the element
- `isEmpty()` and `size()`
- `peek()`/`front()`
	- Access but not modify front
### But lists are just more powerful queues?
- Yes, but queues are better because restriction
- An **abstraction barrier** only gives the client what they need access to
	- Don't need to do operations that are bad for lists

## Stacks
- Always add elements to top and remove them from top
	- "push" and "pop"
- **LIFO:** Last in, first out
- Applied to modeling task interruption and resumption
	- We always resume with the most recently interrupted task
- Only one busy end, so can use either AL or LL in terms of complexity
	- LL is preferred because no `expand()`
### Operations
- `push(element)`
	- adds `element` to stack
- `pop(element)`
	- removes `element` from top of stack
	- may return element
- `isEmpty()` or `size()`
- `peek()`/`front()`
	- Access but not modify front
### But lists are just more powerful stacks?
- Yes, but stacks are better because restriction
- An **abstraction barrier** only gives the client what they need access to
	- Don't need to do operations that are bad for lists
#### Applications
- Useful in analysing nested structure
	- e.g. parenthesis matchingâ€”well balanced?
##### What is well balanced?
Any closers must match *most recent, unmatched* opener
##### Practice
`if expr.length is odd = false`
`for (each char c in expr`

```
init stack
for(each char c in expr) {
		if (c is an opener)
				stack.push(c)
			else //c is a closer
				if (!matches(c, stack.top()) OR stack.isEmpty())
					return false
					else
						stack.pop()
}

//once we have looped through each character and "handled it" stack should be empty
return stack.isEmpty() 
```
