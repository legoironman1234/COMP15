# Sorts
- Selection
- Insertion
- Bubble
- Merge
	- `n log n ` worst case
	- `n log n`  average case 
- Quick
	- `n log n` average case

- Comparison-based sorting can only be `O n log n`

# Sorting without comparison

- Can we get $O(n)$ worst case sorting
- Yes if we do not have to compare each item to each other

## Bucket sort
- *Requires that we know the range of the data type*
	- Ex. integers from range `0-100`
		- Needs a defined range, therefore
- Create a bucket for each value in range
- Assign each element to its bucket
- Read items out of bucket from least to greatest (just read the list) `O(range_size + n)`
	- Using a linked list can easily concatenate `O(1)`

Variant: **counting sort**
	Instead of putting elements in bucket, remember how many of each element there is
	Then save the element at the bucket as many times as there are elements in that bucket

Best, worst, average case: `O(range_size + n)`

Space complexity: 
	`O(range_size)` for counting sort
	`O(range_size + n)` for noncounting sort ( have to store all the elements)

Counting sort will always be stable


Variant: **sort with range**
	Sort into ranges, then sort from there
		Works well with scattered ranges, but basically the same if clustered range

## Radix sort
- **Radix** is the base system of a number
- Least signficant digit 

- Create bin for each digit of a number system
	- Base 10 uses 10
- Place each element in the bin corresponding to its LSD
	- Must be in the same order (==stable==)
- Copy elements back out of bins, in order, from smallest to largest bin

- Repeat steps 2 and 3, using next digit to the left, until all digits of the largest number have been processed
	- e.g. go 1's place, 10's place 100's place
	- Pad smaller numbers with 0’s, e.g., change “1” to “001”

How to get the digit in the `pos` place given the `num` and the `base`
	`res = (num / base^pos) mod base`
		`num \ base^pos` moves to the place
		`mod base` gets LSD
**Time Complexity**

`n` size of list
`b` base
`d` max digits in any element

Loop of 
	Compution of bin and insert into bin is `O(n)`
	Concatenate all the lists in bins `O(n+b)` or `O(b)` if linked list
runs `d` times

$\therefore O(d \cdot (n + b))$

`b` is practically constant, since bases are pretty small
$\therefore O(d \cdot n)$

`d` is practically constant, since integers can really only store so many digits
$\therefore O(n)$

But, `b` and `d` might still be pretty big, so we might think that `O(n log n)` comparison sorts

**Space Complexity**

`O(b + n)`


### MSD Radix sort
- Recursive
- Works its way down
- Sometimes can stop easly because the elements of the list might already be sorted after a while
- Can do variable length strings, but LSD radix cannot
- Lots of stack space because of function calls
