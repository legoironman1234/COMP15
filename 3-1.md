# Back to BSTs

## `remove(key)`

- Find node to remove  $O(n)$
Easy cases: $O(1)$
- empty tree: nothing to do 
- Leaf: update parent pointer and delete it
Harder case: $O(1)$
- Node to be removed has one child
	- Bypass the node in the tree
Hardest case: $O(n)$
- Node to be removed has more than two children
	- Need to find a node to replace old node in structure
		- General rule of thumb: *replace with the largest value in left subtree or the smallest value in the right subtree*
		- *Go with the former*
1. Find max(left subtree) $O(n)$
2. Call remove recursively $O(1)$
	- Removed node will only have 0 or 1 calls, because it is rightmost node in subtree
# AVLs
- To balance a tree
- **AVL:** A BST that auto balances
	- Want a fast $O(1)$ way to balance
- A **perfect binary tree** can only have $2^{k}- 1$ nodes
- For every node in a nonempty tree, the node's left and right subtrees can differ in height by at most 1
$$\textrm{balance factor} = \bigg|\textrm{left subtree height} - \textrm{right subtree height}\bigg| \leq 1$$
- Have to store heights in Node struct, make sure to update it!

## `AVL::insert()`
- Only nodes on the path to the newly inserted nodes can be unbalanced
- An out of balance node will be exactly 2 $\implies O(1)$
	- By AVL invariant, node's balance factor was at most 1 before insert
	- 1 additional node can change height of subtree by at most 1
```c++
Node *insert(Node *node, val) {
if (node == nullptr): node = newNode(val)
else if (val < node->data):
	node->left = insert(node->left, val)
else: node->right = insert(node->right, val)

//update height of node
//check balance of node

return node;

}
```

1. Find node that is out of balance on path to insertion
2. For any out of balance node it can be ()
	- *LL(child, subtree)*  **outside**
	- *RR(child, subtree*  **outside**
	- *RL(child, subtree)* **inside**
	- *LR(child, subtree)*  **inside**
### Fixing outside cases
- Single rotation (to the right for a, to the left for b)
- Have to update 3 pointers

#### Balancing LL
1. Perform standard BST insertion
2. Moving from newly inserted node up to root, find the first node (if any) that is out of balance
3. Perform single right rotation

#### Balancing RR
1. Perform standard BST insertion
2. Moving from newly inserted node up to root, find the first node (if any) that is out of balance
3. Perform single left rotation

### Fixing inside cases

#### Balancing LR
1. Perform standard BST insertion
2. Double rotation
 - Rotate once to get to familiar state
	 - Left rotation at left child of out of balance node **turns into LL case**
 - Rotate again to get to desired state
	 - LL rotation algorithm

#### Balancing RL
For an out of balance node *k*
1. Perform right rotation at k->right
2. Perform left rotation at right
