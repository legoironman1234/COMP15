# Templates

Change the type of a function

A template is a specific kind of function or class
1. Define a function in terms of a type variable 
	-  `template <typename ElemType>` before signature
2. Instantiate the specific type of the function later 
	- `<ElemType>` sometimes when doing an instance of a function

Can have a class template

When refer to method: Need to define template and instantiate class template with template name

**For templates must place everything in .h file, no .cpp file**

**parametric polymorphism:** Not respective of type now

Get more modular code
Can no longer separate interface/implementation
Error messages are bad: ==Write with type, then paratm
