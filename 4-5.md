# Graphs!
- Last data structure of the semester :(((

## Definition
- *Nodes or vertices* connect via *edges or arcs*
- A linked list is a graph, a tree is a graph
- Not all nodes have to be linked!
## Usage 
- Model entities and their relationships
- e.g. social media network to represent friendships
- Google asks *what are the websites with the most incoming links*
- Find the shortest distance, lowest cost, no stopovers using graphs
### Control flow graphs
- Tests to see if each block of code is executed
	- Test suite tests to see if each block of code written is touched, or else something is wrong!

## Types of graphs
- *directed* or *undirected*
	- either each edge has an arrow, or it doesn't 
	- one-directional or two-dimensional
- *weighted* or *unweighted*
	- Each edge has a value or it does not
	- numerical = weight, not numerical = label
- Layout of graph does not matter, boils down that vertices and edges are the same

## Common graph questions
- Shortest path between two vertices
- Lowest cost path between two vertices (weighted graph)

## Representing a graph
- *Vertices* are structs, usually store a list of them in vector
	- But, we need all the nodes, you can't just use *one* to get *all*
- *Edges* are the pairs of vertices in graphs, but might need to know
	- Direction 
	- Weight
### Adjacency matrix
- Size $n \cdot n$ matrix where $(i,j)$ entry is the $(from, to)$
	- Either store a *bool* saying if there is an edge
	- Or store the weight or label in the table, and *choose a good sentinel value*
- Undirected graph $\iff$ $A = A^T$
	- Can save upper triangle of matrix, and take up *half* the space
- Getting edges is O(1)
- Space complexity of adjacency matrix is $O\bigg(\big|V\big|^2\bigg)$
	- This is not good because in *sparse graphs (graphs with little connections)* many empty connections
- To iterate over all edges in graph: $O\bigg(\big|V\big|^2\bigg)$
- Adjacency matrix can make multiplication easy
### Adjacency list
- For each vertex, there is a collection of vertices that are adjacent to it
- ==Clear advantage:== Only need to have space for existing edges
- Space complexity: $O\bigg(\big|V\big|\bigg)$ lists + $O\bigg(\big|E\big|\bigg)$ edges  $=O\bigg(\big|V\big| + \big|E\big|\bigg)$
	- Also time complexity on going through each edge
- ==If collection is BST, can be log complexity or if collection is hash, can be constant complexity==
- Use if $|E| > |V|^2$
