# Priority Queues
- A new ADT, easily implemented with the heap
- **triage:** most important get visited first, think about in hospitals
	- placed in different order of their priority
- **Triage** is not FIFO
- Front of line in a priority queue is the element with the highest quality
- Examples: BOARDING AN AIRPLANE (first, business, economy plus, economy) !!, task schedulers, Dijkstra's algorithm, Huffman  coding, Prim's algorithm
- **Definition:** A container that allows us to find the next most important value
	- Easy access to min/max element

## Implementation oddities
- How to handle equal items in the order of the priority?
- Do lower numbers have higher or lower priority?

## Keys and Values
- Key/value pair is used to make the priority queue
- Prioritised by key

## Comparing Priorities
- Need a **comparator** function
	- Returns a boolean given two elements (e.g. is left more important than right?)

## Implementation

`insert(key, value)`
	Access correct queue: O(1)
	Insert into queue: O(1)
	**O(1)**
	
`minElement()`
	return value of minKey
	Find first non-empty queue: O(n)
	Get front of queue: O(1)
	**O(n)**

`minKey()`
	return minimum key in PQ
	**O(n)**

`removeMin()`
	`pop()`

`size()`

`isEmpty()`

Simply an array of Queues with different priorities
	Has to be a small/known number of priorities, less efficient if not

# Heaps
- Very effective method for priority queues
- min-heap and max-heap
- Binary tree with two invariants
	- Shape property
	- Heap property
### Shape property
- Each level is full, except the last possibly
- Last level is filled left to right
- ==All heaps of a particular size _n_ have the same shape==
### Heap property
- Parents have higher priority than children
	- For min-heap, parent key is less than any child key
	- For max-heap, parent key is greater than any child key
- Children's order does not matter

## Implementation
- ArrayLists work very well because *constant time*
	- Starting at index 1, fill in with a LEVEL ORDER TRAVERSAL

### Find an element
For an element at position $i$
	- left child = $2i$
	- right child = $2i + 1$
	- parent = $i\over2$
	- Given any arbitrary array representing a complete tree of size $S$, what is the position of the last (i.e., rightmost, lowest), non-leaf node in the tree? **$floor\big( {S\over2} \big)$

### `minElement()`
- Get data at 1

### Meta-algorithm
- Reestablish shape property, *ignore heap property*
- Restablish heap property, *without ruining shape property*
- Update size


### `insert()`
- insert at heap size + 1 (naive insert in terms of heap property)
- Increment heap property 
- Bubble up/up-heap
	- Compare the inserted element with its parent â€” if in correct order, **stop!**
	- **If not**, swap and up-heap from parent
		- Do not need to worry about the other child, because we had a heap before
- **Ends up as $O(\log n)$ as have to go through number of levels**
	- Average complexity is actually O(1)

### `removeMin()`
- Save and remove root
	- To maintain shape, replace root with last element in array
- Decrement size 
- Bubble down/down-heap
	- Compare the root with its children, if in correct order, stop.
	- If not, swap with smallest child, and bubble down from there.
	- Be careful to check whether the children exist (if right exists, left must...)
- **$O(\log n)$, maximum of number of levels

### `buildHeap()`
- naive insert over and over: $O(n \log n)$
- heapify

### `heapify()`
- Insert all elements into an array
	- Shape property already filled
	- Leaves all satisfy heap property (all leaves have no children)
- Start at $floor\big( {S\over2} \big)$, moving backwards, and bubble down on nonleaf node
- **This is** $O(n)$
