# Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Dijkstra is a cool dude
- Shortest graph problem, but with a weighted graph, *not necessarily the shortest amount of edges*
- Similar to **BFS**
	- Given a starting node, finds shortest path to all other nodes
	- Init starting node distance to 0, other to infinity
	- Pick a new node, distances, marks it as known
- Different to **BFS**
	- Shortest current distance gets updated as go on
	- Algorithm picks the current node with the lowest current distance

## Algorithm
- Set starting node's dist to 0, all others' dist to infinity
- Mark all nodes "Unknown"
- Repeat until all nodes are "known"
	- Choose the unknown node with the smallest distance (will be starting node first)
	- For all neighbors of node, update the neighbor's distance only if new dist is smaller than old dist (min of the distances)
	- Mark unknown node as known

- Assuming there are no negative edge weights, all other paths out of starting node are longer than path to node found by Dijkstra's algorithm

- **greedy algorithm** Pick the *locally optimal option*
	- Means Dijsktra's algorithm can only work on positive weights

## Example

$v_i$ is the node that you visit
| Node | Known  | Prev (via which node) | Dist | v = 1 | v = 4 | v = 2                            | v = 3 | v = 5 | v = 7 |
| ---- | ------ | --------------------- | ---- | ----- | ----- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |

| 2    | F -> T     | 1                     | 2    | 2     |       |                                  |       |       |       |

| 6    | F -> T    | 4   -> 3  -> 7                | 9  -> 8 -> 6 |       | 9     |                                  |   found better: 8   |       |   6    |
| 7    | F  -> T    | 4                     | 5    |       | 5     |                                  |       |       |       |


Nothing will change at the last iteration, because every other node has been seen

## Complexity
- To add each vertex to a priority queue $$O(\|V\|\log\|V\|)$$
- To look at each neighbor of all nodes in a queue$$O(\|E\|\log\|V\|)$$
- While loop the above runs in$$O(\|V\|\log\|V\|)$$
- Whole algorithm is: $$O\Bigg(\log\|V\| \cdot \bigg(\|V\|+ \|E\|\bigg)\Bigg)$$
	- with adjacency matrix: $$O\Bigg(\|V\|^2 \cdot \bigg(\|V\|+ \|E\|\bigg)\Bigg)$$

- Replacing 6 dist with 10 (smaller than inf)
- Replacing 7 dist (smaller than inf)
- Replacing 2 dist (smaller than inf)
- Set 1 as known, no more neighbors
- Business as usual for 6
- 
- Found better path to 7 from 2
- Found better path to 4 from 3
- Found better path to 5 from 4

- Nothing on last step
