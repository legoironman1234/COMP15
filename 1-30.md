## The Big Three Recap
- If you want one, you want all
- Define all three when heap allocated memory (pointers)
### Assignment operator overloading
- An assignment operator overloading method can deep copy data
	- ==const data as a data type should probably be reference==
		- wastes time and space to make a copy of the data
- Output of a function is an object reference
	- Helps with chaining an assignment operator call
		- `x = y = z;` Note: In assignment, right side always gets evaluated first
### Copy constructor
- `Class a; Class c(a);`
- `Class a; Class c = a;` Declare and assign on same line->copy constructor
- Function calls
	- Entering a function as a parameter
	- Returning a value from the function back to the parent function
==Requires reference parameter when defining copy constructor else infinite loop of needing copy constructor==

### Destructor
- Recycle heap allocated memory used by class

#### For `CharArrayList.cpp`
```c++
CharArrayList &CharArrayList::operator=(const CharArrayList &other) {
	if (this = &rhs)
		return *this;

	//DEEP COPY
		//recycle memory for left hand side
		//allocate new memory for left hand side
		//copy member variables of rhs
		//for heap allocated array: copy each element of an array
	return *this;
}
```

==If we do not check if objects are the same, we might unintentionally change rhs if they are the same, because it would delete the memory we are trying to copy==

## Linked Lists
### Introduction
- List ADT, defined in operations
	- `addAtBack`
	- `addAtFront`
	- `size`
	- `addAt`
	- `removeAt`
	- `isEmpty`
	- `elementAt`
- ArrayList elements are stored **contiguously** memory
	- Given address of first index: `address of index i = i * sizeof(TYPE) + address of first index`  ==good==
	- ArrayList has large copy method compute times ==bad==
	- ArrayList you have to search full array list to find an element ==bad==
	- Have to shift subsequent elements of array when inserting or removing ==bad==
		- Especially at front
	- Growing array is time expensive but `2 * capacity + 2`
		- Pretty time efficient (Do not have to do it a lot)
		- Not storage efficient (Takes up a lot more space than really needed)
	- What about `size++`
		- Not time efficient (Have to do it more)
		- Storage efficient (Takes up less space)
### Foundation
- Nodes
	- Contain data and pointer to next node on list
- Each node is **not contiguous** in memory
	- So, each node has to keep track of only the next node
- *Always* need to have 
	- a pointer to front of the list
	- ==sentinel== value to signifiy end of list (`nullptr`)
	- Optional: a pointer to the end of the list
		- Instaneous access to *both* front and back
### Recursive definition
- Linked list is either
	- empty (`nullptr`) ==base case==
	- A node with a piece of data, and a pointer to a smaller *linked list* ==recursive case==
### Implementation
- Keep node private
	- Client does not need to see the node in the class, just cares that it is a list
	- Because node is private must scope in return type and in method, but parameters do not need scoping
		- `Class::Node *Class::newNode(Data elem, Node *next) {}`

#### `addAtFront()`
- Create a node with data
- Set next pointer of node to first element in list
- Update front to point to new node
	- This is done last because we need to 
	1. Call the front of the list to point to next in the new front
	2. Reassign front to the new front
==No shifting over like in AL==

```c++
Class::Node *Class::newNode(Data elem, Node *next) {
	Node *new_node = new Node;
	new_node->data = elem;
	new_node->next = next;
	return new_node;
}

void Class::addAtFront() {
	front = newNode(elem, front);
}
```

#### `printLoopily()`
```c++
	Node* curr = front; //front can stay AT the front
	while (curr != nullptr) {
		cout << curr->data << " ";
		curr = curr->next; //"iterate" through list
	}
	cout << '\n';

	//can also define with for loop
	for (Node* curr = front; curr != nullptr; curr = curr->next) {
		cout << curr->data << " ";	
	}
	cout << '\n'
	
```

#### `printRecursively()`

==Helper functions for public functions are *private*

```c++
		printRecHelper(front); 
		//Private because the print function needs arguments, but client should not need to use clients

void printRecHelper(Node *curr) {
	if (curr == nullptr) { //base case, reached the end of the list
		cout << '\n'; //for formatting
		return;
	} else {
		cout << curr->data << " ";
		printRecHelp(curr->next); // "iterate"
	}
}
```

#### `~Class()` 

```c++
	recycleRecursive();

void recycleRecursive() {
	if (curr == nullptr) {
		return;
	} else {
		recycleRecursive(curr->next); //opens up whole list, then deletes the LAST node FIRST and
		//moves backwards s.t. there are no references to freed memory 
		
		delete curr; 
	}
}
```
