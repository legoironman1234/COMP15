- Do gerp
# Sorting
- Sorting is old and cool
- By the way, its to put a list in order
	- Create a permutation of the original list such that elements are in non-decreasing order (accounts for duplicates)
- Items must be comparable
- We consider the worst, best, and average case complexity
### **Three problems**
- Best worst-case is $O(n\log n)$
- **In-place** vs **Out-of-place** (memory used is constant, or varies based on input)
- **Stable** vs **Unstable** (preserve the original order)

## Three big ones
- Selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort

## Selection sort
Array is divided into sorted and unsorted

- Locate min element in spots 0..(n-1) ==n operations==
	- Swap with first element of unsorted array 
-  ==n - 1 operations==
-  ==n - 2 operations==
-  ==n - 3 operations==
- Do this n total times

**Therefore, selection sort is $O(n^2)$**

We would still have to iterate over the full array to determine the correct spot no matter what $\implies$ **best, average, worst case complexities are the same** 

This is in place (constant memory used)

Unstable order, order of duplicates can change!
	Consider on `[3, 2, 3, 1]`

## Insertion sort
Array is divided into sorted and unsorted, sorted starts as first array

Starting at second element, slide to the left if its lesser than element until it is sorted

Best case: $O(n)$
	Already sorted list

Worst case: $O(n^2)$
	Reverse sorted list

Average case: $O(n^2)$

This is in place (constant memory used)

Unstable: (equal elements can swap)
	Consider on `[3, 2, 3, 1]`

## Bubble sort 

- Iterate, swap any adjacent out of order elements
	- After the ith iteration the last i elements will **be sorted**
- Iterate until gone n times

Best case: $O(n)$

Worst case: $O(n^2)$
	Reverse sorted

Average case: $O(n^2)$

This is in place (constant memory used)

Stable

## In practice

Insertion sort is better than bubble sort, because it is less redundant
	Bubble sort has to complete all iterations
	Bubble sort makes many redundant comparisons
	Bubble sort is stupid and dumb
