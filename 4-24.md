- `gerp` chaining should be used for only having collisions
	- Not the same key and having it map to multiple different values

# Sorting again


## Merge and quick sorts

- Same meta algorithm (recursive)

- List size is 0 or 1, already sorted
- Divide the list into two sublists 
	- Merge sort cuts the two sublists in half
	- Quick sort harder to cut
- Recursively sort the sublists
- Combine the sorted sublists
	- Merge sort harder to combine the lists
	- Quick sort is easy contacentation

## `mergesort`

```
mergesort

// all the way down one branch then move to the next

if list_size is 0 or 1
	sorted 
else 
	recursively call merge sort on both halves
	merge the two // this part is hard
```

```
mergesort merge
	compare the two front elements
	merge the smaller one, move onto next element in list
	
	at end just push in the remaining list if there is one
```

### Time complexity
- $O(n \log n)$ process for every merge
- $O(\log n)$ levels to be merged
- $O(n \log n)$ overall

No matter what list, even if sorted (best case), `mergesort` will always be $O(n \log n)$
	Still good, because $O(n \log n)$ is better than $O(n^2)$

### Space complexity
- Result array created $\therefore$ out of place
	- $O(n)$ extra space (sum of all extra arrays allocated)

### Stability
- How are dup's treated?
- If pull from left first, we will always have a stable sort
	- Since order would be preserved

## `quicksort`

1. Select a pivot element
	- Just use the first element
2. Partition the list into elements that are greater than the pivot, and smaller than the pivot
	- Partitioned items will have order preserved from original list
	- 
1. Recursively sort each sublist
2. Concatenate first sublist, pivot, and sublist

```
hoare partition procudure

in place version of quick sort

choose a pivot and rearrange array into greater and less than the pivot

make pivot at the left index

repeat while left < right

	while data[right] > data[pivot] and left<right
		decrement right
	while data[left] <= data[pivot] and left<right
		increment left
	swap(data[left], data[right])

swap (data[left/right], data[pivot])

return the pivot index
```

#### Implementation pitfalls
- Off by one errors
- Where to use the comparison vs comparison and equal
- When using an index vs element
- Move right before moving left

### Time complexity
- Partitioning is $O(n)$
	- Must compare each element with pivot, and swap
- When pivot is approximately median element, there is a shorter tree $\therefore O(\log n)$
- Total best case is $O(n \log n)$

- If pivot is not a good estimate of median (max or min)
	- Highly lopsided sublists $O(n^2)$
	- Have to peel off each element one by one and compare it to each other element
	**Sorting already sorted list is therefore very slow**
		Instead of picking first element as pivot, pick random element, or middle element, or take median of first, last, and middle elements.


Best case: $O(n \log n)$

Worst case: $O(n^2)$

Average case: $O(n \log n)$

### Space complexity
- To keep track of the left and right positions when making a partition, they are function parameters of a *recursive function*
	- This means that new integers are pushed to the stack, for each function call $\therefore O(\log n)$ extra space

### Stability
- Unstable
	- Consider Hoare partitioning on `[3, 4, 4, 1]`
