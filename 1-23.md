## Encapsulation:
public vs private 
- by default 
	- classes' members are private
	- structs' members are public

==All member variables must be private in a class in CS15

Getter functions return the value of a member variable
Setter functions update (and check for variance)

## `cerr` vs `cout`
`cout` is buffered to memory
`cerr` is printed as soon as it is ran
different ways to process different output streams
==`cerr` is typically used for debugging and error messages, as it can print before seg faults

## Splitting code into multiple files

`#ifndef __EMPLOYEE_H_`
`#define __EMPLOYEE_H_`
`//class definition`
`#endif` -> these are called macros

If __token__ is not defined, do not include __token__

==Implentation for class will go in **classname.cpp**==
	Has to include the class definition
	`using namespace std;` is only in implementation files

## Compilation and Linking
1. Separately compile each .cpp file
	- usage of `-c` flag tells compiler to compile each file individually
2. Generate a `.o` (object) file for each cpp file
3. Linking the files
	- `clang++ -Wall -Wextra program1.o program2.o`
	- use `-o` flag to rename executable

==Steps 2 and 3 are separated because it is more efficient to compile the files you only edited in **larger projects**==


**First data structure of the class: ArrayLists**

Type: Name for a set values
	e.g `bool = {true, false}`

ADT (abstract data type)
	Tell us what operations define the type

Data structure: A means for organizing and storing data
	We will use to implement ADTs

## Lists

First ADT of the class

- Ordered (≠ Sorted)
- Elements can be of any time
- Size can grow and shrink

Operations on lists: 
	- `void addAtBack(Data datum)`
	- `void addAtFront(Data datum)
	- `int size()`
	- `void addAt(Data datum, int index)`
	- `void removeAt(int index)`
		- no hole in its place, every element after is moved up
	- `bool isEmpty()`
	- `Data dataAt(int index)`

## ArrayLists

Cannot use C++ arrays purely, they do not have variable size

==Can use the heap?==

1. Create a bigger array
2. Reassign `arr` to contain the address of the new array
3. Copy the elements of the old array into the new array
4. Recycle the old array

These are called dynamic arrays, but are called **ArrayLists in this class**

A client should not have to worry about the above steps => Abstraction!

### Implementation

#### Two constructors
1. No elements needed
	- `size to 0
	- `array to nullptr`
	- `capacity to 0`
2. Size and value to occupy array
	- `capacity = 2 * initialSize; `
	- `data = new int[capacity];`
	- `for (int i = 0; i < initialSize; i++) {
		`data[i] = value}
	- `currSize = initialSize;`

#### One deconstructor
1. Deletes the array from dynamic memory

### Compiling 

Makefile—something we will use later

#### Methods
##### `addAtBack()`
- Assume there is enough space
	- If satiated (`currSize == capacity`)=>expand **private method**
- Add data at `currSize` and increment `currSize`

##### expand()
1. Allocate a new, larger array on heap
	- `2 * capacity + 2` 
2. Copy over elements from old array
3. Recycle old array
4. Update relevant vars

##### elementAt()
1. Invariant check
2. Return `data[index]`
