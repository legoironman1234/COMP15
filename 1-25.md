## Homework Logistics
- See autograder score after submit
- Can resubmit up to 5 times
- Start early
- 5 tokens in the semester
- ==Style guide==
	- Read style guide
- ==Exceptions==
	- Look at starter file and virtual lecture

## Unit testing
- Dummy functions
- Test each part of the class
	- Test one "unit" in each program
- Can add functions to `unit_test.cpp` and will be ran through the driver function

### `assert`
- True, everything is fine
- False, crashes program, does not run to completion
- Have to use `#include <cassert>`
```c++
```#include <cassert>
```

## ArrayLists
- Lists in Python
- Arrays in Ruby and JavaScript
- ArrayLists in Java
All implemented the same way

### vectors in C++
- `#include <vector>`
- Use in later assignments

## C++ stuff

### Pass by Value
- Most types are PBV in C++

### Pass by Reference
- Arrays
	- The address of the array is passed to a function
	- Modifying the original array in memory
- Pointers
	- Dereference an address and modify the variable at an address

### Reference parameters
- Usage of the `&` operator next to a variable
```c++
void func(int &x) { //allows us to use x as a normal integer in func
	x = x + 1;
}

int main() {
	int foo = 2;
	func(foo);
	cout << foo; //output is 3

	return 0;
}
```
- Get used to using references—better notation in a function
- Inefficient to make a copy
	- When reading from a variable—definitely use reference
	- When writing from a variable—think about if value can be changed
- References can be returned by a variable the life of the function

### `this` pointer
- `this` keyword is a pointer to the object the function is called on

## The Big Three
- Weird behavior when dealing with classes/structs and heap memory
- If you want one of them, you should define all of them
	- When any member variables use heap-allocated memory
- ==See `deep_example.cpp` on website== 

### Shallow Copy 
- A value's members are copied, but no deeper than that
	- S.t. a pointer that is copied is still pointing to the same address
- Default C++ copy
- This is a problem
- Heap variables will go under double free during destruction
	- Destructors are called in reverse order of declaration

### Deep Copy (The Solution!)
- Copy s.t. that the pointer copies the value pointed to
#### Overloading the assignment operator
```c++
Person p1, p2;
p2 = p1;
// Overloaded assignment operator
    Person &operator=(const Person &rhs) //operator= function is redefining the operator
    {
    //do the left hand side (p2) and the right hand side (p1) have the same address in memory?
        if (this == &rhs) { 
        //Yes, just return the left hand side, it's the same thing
            return *this;
        }

        *age = *rhs.age;
        name = rhs.name;
        return *this;        
    }
```

- With this, we can chain assignments 
	- `x = y = z`
- Most of the function will be the same
	- But deep copying the pointer variables might require some extra thinking

### Copy constructor
- Creates a new object using an existing object
```c++
Person p2(p1);
Person p2 = p1; 
//These are the same lines

Person(const Person &other) { //has to be a reference s.t. a copy of the input is not made
							  //else the copy constructor will be called infinitely
	age = new int; //First time making space on the heap, as it is a constructor
	*age = *other.age;
	name = other.name;
}
```
### Destructor
- Deallocate heap memory
