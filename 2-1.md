# Linked lists
- Stores a node
	- Data
- A pointer to the next node
- A pointer to the back node (optional)

*Not contiguous in memory*

## Wrapper functions

Problem: Don't want to start with giving an argument
- e.g. in destructors or print methods

Solution: Make a **wrapper function** that takes starts with an argument
- e.g. `front` pointer  

## Linked lists in memory
Pros: Cannot calculate list memory addresses based on indices

Cons: Easier to add elements

## `removeFront()`
1. Set old front to new pointer
2. Set new front to front
3. Recycle memory at old front

==Much cheaper than in ArrayLists==

## `elementAt(int index)`
1. Keep track of current node and a count 
2. Iterate through list, and increment count, until count == index

==Less cheaper than in ArrayLists==

## `insertAt(int index, string data)`

1. Specific case for front pointer
2. Keep track of current node and a count 
3. Find `index - 1` to insert new node 
	- `while` loop
4. new node next pointer is set to `list[index]` next pointer
5. `list[index - 1]` next pointer is set to a new node of data

==Finding is expensive in linked lists, inserting is cheap ==
- opposite in linked lists

## Carefuls
- Can't access pointer for recycled node
- Only update a pointer if what it is currenty pointing to is saved 
- When `node->next` is `nullptr`
- Empty, singleton
- inserting/removing front or end

## Variations
- Circular list
	- "last" points to first node
- Header and trailer nodes
	- Empty pointer nodes
		- Easier handling of edge cases
- Doubly linked lists
	- Forwards and backwards pointer

## Doubly linked list
#### `insertAt(int index, string data)`

- new node next = curr next
- new node prev = curr
- curr next = new node
- new node next prev = new node

## Which is faster?

- elementAt: AL faster
	address math (fast) vs. iterate through (slow)
- addAtBack: AL faster, both if LL has a back member
- addAtFront: LL
	no growing of array each time
- size/isEmpty: same, assuming both have a size member variable
- addAt/removeAt: close to back: AL, doubly linked list with back pointer | close to front: LL

# Makefiles

### Making an executable
- Compilation
	- `-c` flag with `clang++` to change to `.o`
- Linking
	- making `.o`'s into executable

Problem: Fairly repetitive, how can we automate?
	Can be tedious and slow to recompile programs that have not been changed
Solution: `make`
#### `make`
```
target: prerequisites
	recipe \\must be a tab before recipe
```

target: argument to give to make
	- e.g. run `make target` in terminal
prerequisites: things that files depend on
recipe: command that we want to run

#### `Makefile` variables
- `CXX`: compiler
- `CXXFLAGS`: compiler flags
- `LDFLAGS`: linker flags
- `$@`: target name of current rule
- `$^`: list of all prerequisites
- `$<`: name of first prequisite 

#### Separating Rules
1. Combination files
	- Target is filename of `.o` file 
	- Prerequisite is the corresponding `.cpp` file, then any necessary `.h` files
2. Linking files
	- Builds final executable by linking `.o`
	- Goes first so we can just run `make` when wanting to run this target

#### Built-in Rules
- `X.o` rules have a built-in recipe
	- Just involve the correct prerequisites

#### Phony targets
- Do another task other than compile/link
- `clean`
	- Removes exec, linker files, temp files (linker target, `.o`, `~`)
	- add `-f` "force flag" to `rm` command
