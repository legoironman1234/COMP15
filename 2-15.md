# Admin
- Diff test different streams together
	- e.g. output must all go to the proper output streams (cerr, cout, ofstream)

# Recursion

### `num_coins`
- Find how many coins you need to take away in decreasing increments
- Then ask again how many coins you need to take away (call `num_coins()` again), until 0 coins are needed

### Helpers
- Within a wrapper
- Takes additional parameters

### GCD
- Try all ints from n to 1 until there is one that divides both m and n
- Use a helper function with m n and guess number and decrement through until m % guess and n % guess both are 0

### Palindrome
- if last == first
	- strings with 0 or 1 characters are palindromes
- else
	- return true
		- if first and last char are equal and
		- if the smaller palindrome is a palindrome
==short-circuiting:== evaluate the first bool statement then evaluate the second bool statement

### Downsides
- Lots of stack memory used to create new function calls
	- Extra space and time
- Recursive functions can be very time inefficient
	- e.g. reperforming of computations in a Fibonacci sequence
- Some compilers rewrite functions that avoid recursion
- **Tail recursion:** When the last call in a function is the recursive call
	- Reuse exact same space (activation record) on stack


# Binary Search
- $O(n)$ if we do not know anything about the list
- What if we know the list is sorted from smallest to largest?

### Sorted search: High-level implementation
- Start with the middle index
- If list is the middle, found it!
- Else search the left and right subtree

Exists in real life
	Looking through a dictionary for a word

### Complexity
- Each comparison cuts the search space in half
	$O(\log)n$
- Faster than $O(n)$, less comparisons

### Restrictions
- List must be sortable
	- A custom type can be sortable if you define the `>` or `<` operators
- Only good in ArrayLists
	- Because you have to access the middle, can do this easy in AL, but requires traversal in LL

# Sets
- Unordered, duplicate-free collection of elements
	- $\{4,7,17\}$ is the same as $\{7,17,4\}$
- Useful in if someone is a member of a group
### Operations
- `add(element)`
	add an element to set
	$O(n)$
- `remove(element)`
	remove an element from set
	$O(n)$
- `size()`
	gets size
	$O(1)$
- `contains(element)`
	is this element there
	$O(n)$
- `union()`
	Gets the all unique elements between two sets
	$O(n^2)$
- `intersection()`
	Gets the elements in both A and B
	$O(n^2)$
- `subtract()`
	Gets the elements in A but not in B
	$O(n^2)$
- `isSubset()`
	A is subset of B iff all elements of A are in B
	$O(n^2)$
### Complexity
- Same complexity on operations in AL and LL
- Quadratic time because of searching is a little slowâ€”what if it was sorted?
### Sorted lists complexity
- `add(element)`
	- Binary search, $O(\log n)$
	- Have to shift over $O(n)$
- All others are still the same complexity except for:
- `isSubset()`
	- $O(n \log n)$
### Practice
- A fixed case is a **binary search tree**
	- ordered set is with BST
	- unordered set is with hash
